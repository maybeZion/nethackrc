# About
.nethackrc file for NetHack 3.7, although it should mostly work on lower versions. This file is comprised of several other people's rc files, with some of my own additions and optimizations.

# Features
 - Menucolors to indicate BUC status of identified and equipped items, as well as status effects and most magic items.
 - Msgtype rules to better warn the player of hunger, status, and events like the presence of a mind flayer or gaining an intrinsic.
 - Sane defaults and QoL options in an attempt to make the game more accessible.
 - Much more!

# Installation
Copy .nethackrc to your home folder. Default settings make use of IBMGraphics, which may require additional setup. Windows users should consult the NetHack wiki.
