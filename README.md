# About
.nethackrc file for NetHack 3.7, although it should mostly work on lower versions and some variants (specifically xNetHack). This file is comprised of several other people's rc files, with some of my own additions and optimizations. If your work is in this file uncredited and you don't like it, please get in touch with me and I will add your name promptly.

# Features
 - Tailored and sane autopickup rules.
 - Msgtype rules to better warn the player of hunger, status, and events like the presence of a mind flayer or gaining an intrinsic (this may be disruptive for some players).
 - Menucolors to indicate the BUC status of items.
 - underlined equipped items. This also works with the above feature.
 - Status highlights for Health and Power, including the 1/7 prayer threshold.
 - Status highlights for Stat changes, XP Level, and all conditions.
 - Flavor menucolors for many items.

# Installation
Copy .nethackrc to your home folder. Windows users should consult the NetHack wiki.
